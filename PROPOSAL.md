# Project Proposal

For my final project I will be doing a machine learning project. Specifically I will be using Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies, NEAT for short, which is a genetic algorithm based on a [paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) by Kenneth Stanley in 2002 used to evolve neural networks to do complex tasks. I will use this algortihm to evolve a neural network to play a simple game or run a simmulation. The complexity of my game or simmulation will depend on how I can get the algorithm working. I will code the game myself but my focus for this project will be the machine learning aspect of it and not developing the game.

An example of an AI evolved by this algorithm is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44&t=280s)
My project probably will not look as complex and impressive but I will try to come up with something original and interesting to deploy my network on.
## Libraries:
#### NEAT C++
I will be using NEAT C++ [library](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?neat-c) to evolve my network.
This library has no formal documentation page but the code is well commented and by looking at it I could understand what the code does and how to use it. In addition, there are available demos and their source codes that I can look at.

#### Game Library
This is unlikely, but I might use a library to develop my game. This will depend on how using a library will make things for me easier and that if it is worth my time to learn how to use the library. I would say this is unlikely because I believe openFrameWorks also provides some nice interfances which makes developing games and graphical applications easier.
