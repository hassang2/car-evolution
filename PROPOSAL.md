# Project Proposal

For my final project I will be doing a machine learning project. Specifically I will be using Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies, NEAT for short, which is a genetic algorithm based on a paper by Kenneth Stanley in 2002 LINK PAPER used to evolve neural networks to do complex tasks. I will use this algortihm to evolve a neural network to play a simple game or run a simmulation. The complexity of my game or simmulation will depend on how I can get the algorithm working. I will code the game myself but my focus for this project will be the machine learning aspect of it and not developing the game.

An example of an AI evolved by this algorithm is here.


#Libraries
##NEAT C++
I will be using NEAT C++ library LINK (http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?neat-c) to evolve my network.
This library has no formal documentation page but the code is well commented and by looking at it I could understand what the code does and how to use it. In addition, there are available demos and their source codes that I can look at.

##Game Library
This is unlikely, but I might use a library to develop my game. This will depend on how using a library will make things for me easier and that if it is worth my time to learn how to use the library.
