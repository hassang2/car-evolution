# Dev Logs

## NEAT:
### LOG

* cleared the experiments .cpp and .h files.
* added a test experiment to classify numbers as positive or negative.
* after much effort, the positive-negative classifier is working now with 100% accuracy.


### TODO

* Figure out how to change the activation function of the network so that it could be used for multiclass classification and regression



### ISSUES

## Race Game:
## LOG

* Copy pasted code from snake game.
* Modified the pasted code to fit my game (added car/ai/track classes)
* code compiles and shows a straight line and circle.
* Circle now can move to right and left with A or D or left/right arrows
* changed the circle to rectangle.
* Rectnagle now rotates properly when it turns right or left
