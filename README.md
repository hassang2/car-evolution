# CS 126 FinalProject

An AI trained with genetic algorithm playing a track racing game created in openFramework

## Motivation
This is my final project for CS 126 course. Since I am really interested in machine learning I decided to pick a ML project to learn more about it.

## Features
You can play the game by your self or watch the AI play the game. Don't forget that if you touch the walls you are dead! You can also make custom tracks and save/load them.

## How to use?
set the bool value "evolution_mode" in setup function in app.cpp to false if you want to control the car and set it to true if you want to watch cars evolve.

## Libraries used
Box2d for physics and objects
NEAT C++ for AI

## Credits
ALL the code for the game is written by me (not copy/pasted from anywhere). the code for the ai is from the NEAT library but I have made major changes to the experiments file so it works with my game.
