# CS 126 FinalProject

An AI trained with genetic algorithm playing a track racing game.

## Motivation
This is my final project for CS 126 course. Since I am relly interested in machine learning I decided to pick a ML project to learn more about it.

## Features
You can play the game by your self or compete with an AI or watch the AI play the game. Don't forget that if you touch the walls you are dead! You can also make custom tracks and save/load them.

## How to use?
Since I am in the middle of integrating the AI, the game itself is unplayable but it can be run. You can see the car and track. You can move the car and it will be colliding with the track. If you drive along the line in the middle of the track your score goes up.

## Work in Progress
I am working on the ai part. Once I get it working, u can see the process of evolution of the cars.


## Credits

ALL the code for the game is written by me (not copy/pasted from anywhere). the code for the ai is from the NEAT library but I have made major changes to the experiments file so it works with my game.
